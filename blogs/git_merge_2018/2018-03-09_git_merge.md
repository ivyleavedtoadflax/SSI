# Some takeaways from git merge 2018

On 8th March I was lucky enough to go to annual git conference in Barcelona. With it being just 30 minutes from home, it was not something I could miss, especially after being kindly offered a ticket by Raniere, who sadly could not make it.

First of all it is worth saying a congratulations (and thank you) to all the organisers and sponsers of git merge from: github, gitlab, bitbucket, microsoft, and stickermule. It was a slick and well organised event that went without hitch, served excellent food, and took place in the impressive 16th Century Convent of the Angels at Barcelona's Museum of Contemporary Art, just 10 minutes walk from Placa de Catalunya: the centre of the city.

One of the interesting things about going to a conference about all things git, is that there is a huge range of people who attend. To many (perhaps most) software developer`s, git is an essential paty of their daily work: so the range of people who might attend is very wide. Aside from software developers who use and are interested in git, there were two other distinct groups of people attending: those who are not yet git users (or have just become git users) and wanted to learn more about using git, perhaps at workshops; and those with very deep expertise in git, perhaps core developers at github, gitlab, or bitbucket, or the git kernel itself. It was an international event: I spoke to delegates from Belgium, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and theUSA.

There were a wide range of [presentations](https://git-merge.com/); these were my were my highlights:

[Diane Hosfelt](https://twitter.com/avadacatavra?lang=en) from Mozilla presented about the importance of putting security critical code in plain sight, and managing it with a sensible workflow. Diane, like myself a recovering civil servant, noted the change in culture that moving to Mozilla and working openly on security critical browser components was to her. Working in government (and indeed any security conscious large organisation) there is sometimes a reluctance to share work within the organisation, let alone without. This cultural barrier to openess is sometimes motivated by nothing more than fear that others might criticise our cod. But as Diane pointed out when she asked: 'How many of you have tried to read the source code of OpenSSL' (not very many at all it seemed): just because your code is in the open, doesn't mean anyone is actually going to read it. Nonetheless publishing openly and managing code with the familiar Issue>Fork>Pull Request>Review>Rebase>Test>Merge workflow is doubly important when it really matters: for security critical code.


[Carlos Martin Nieto](https://twitter.com/carlosmn?lang=en) from GitHub gave an interesting breakdown of the tech behind GitHub backups. __tldr;__ your data is safe with GitHub, and moving from a system of storing data in volumes (on [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)) to storing data as objects (on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) led to 90% savings in their backup costs. Key takeaways for me: if you need to rely on a piece of software, make sure you are using it every day: GitHub makes thousands of backup and restores every day on bespoke software based on git.

[Edward Thomson](https://github.com/ethomson) from Microsoft and the maintainer of [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2) (the library that sits behind git functionality in many git clients), gave a slick demonstration of a security vulnerability which caused him many sleepless nights, and exploited case insensitivity on mac and windows systems, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code using git hooks through a social engineering attack. Edward highlighted the importance of community, which allowed Mercurial (responsible for SVN - which also suffered from the issue), git, libgit2, and GitHub to coordinate simultaneous patch releases to deal with this vulnerability, and the subsequent creation of the git security mailing list to allow better communication going forward.

[William Chia](https://twitter.com/thewilliamchia)'s presentation on [Empowering non-develops to use git](https://williamchia.gitlab.io/git-merge-2018/#/) based on his experiences at GitLab. GitLab loves openess, version control, and collaboration, so much so that gtilab is used by pretty much everyone in the company for pretty much everything. Marketing managers, graphic designers, lawyers, and sales professionals work in markdown using static site generators (like [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), or [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)) for their daily work, allowing easy collaboration that scales effortlessly.

What I love about this approach is that once the cultural barrier to working with something that looks a bit like code (but is actually easy and intuitive) has been overcome, the issue of who did what, when, and why; and how to transmit knowledge within the organisation is at least partially solved. This is a huge issue that many large organisations struggle with, and an approach that is lightweight, easy, and cheap that many other organisation could learn from. Bravo GitLab. Also a peak behind the GitLab curtain: coming this month from GitLab is Continuous Integration/Deployment for GitHub repos from GitLab (this is already supported for native GitLab repos).

Another highlight for me was a presentation on 'Git driven refactoring' by [Ashley Ellis Pearce](https://twitter.com/aellispierce?lang=en) from GitHub. This was a thought provoking and engaging presentation which demonstrated simple but elegant ways for testing adherence to the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) principles using your log and diffs. For example: 'When adding features there should be no red in the diffs' as a way of testing the [Open/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle): essentially if there is red (and you needed to delete something) to add a new feature to a class, then your class is not as open as it should be.

Ashley's presentation was another reminder of why it is so important to write useful commit messages. Having a clean and sensible history created from disciplined commits can become a tool in its own right when seeking to improve the quality of our code.

Finally, another presentation from Microsoft employees: [Derrick Stolee](https://twitter.com/stolee) and [Johannes Schindelin](https://twitter.com/jschindelin) (the latter of whom was responsible for implementing `git rebase -i`) demonstrated the intricacies of bringing a performant git to windows. Now that windows development has been moved over to git, git for windows users will be pleased to see new emphasis on improving performance, driven by the desire to improve the performance of git for windows when dealing with the impressively large windows codebase.

One final thing worthy of note that I was introduced to at the event was [xltrail](https://www.xltrail.com/], a server based tool to add support for excel workbooks (including embedded VBA) to git, allowing excel workbooks to enjoy the same level of version control as plain text files.

All in all, git merge 2018 was a great event, well worth attending in future.
